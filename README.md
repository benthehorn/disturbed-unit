### Task 2:

### Task 3:
This plot looks wrong. I couldn't get it to represent the data as I saw it should be, namely that property near norreport should cost 
more per square metre than properties further away from the city. I tried reversing the y-axis in the code as well as in the plotter, 
but it still looks wrong.

### Task 4:
The two plots below are drawn using the same data. But, the bar plot seems to not show nearly all the data. The normal plot gives a better
representation, for some reason.
